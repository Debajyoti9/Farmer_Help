* Crop Recommendations : 
Enter the corresponding nutrient values of your soil, state and city. Note that, the N-P-K (Nitrogen-Phosphorous-Potassium) values to be entered should be the ratio between them. Note: When you enter the city name, make sure to enter mostly common city names. Remote cities/towns may not be available in the Weather API from where humidity, temperature data is fetched. 

* Fertilizer Suggestions :
Enter the nutrient contents of your soil and the crop you want to grow. The algorithm will tell which nutrient the soil has excess of or lacks. Accordingly, it will give suggestions for buying fertilizers. 

* Disease Detection : 
Upload an image of leaf of your plant. The algorithm will tell the crop type and whether it is diseased or healthy. If it is diseased, it will tell you the cause of the disease and suggest you how to prevent/cure the disease accordingly. Note that, for now it only supports following crops. Supported crops: Apple, Blueberry, Cherry, Corn, Grape, Pepper, Orange, Peach, Potato, Soyabean, Strawberry, Tomato, Squash, Raspberry.
